## [Version 0.3.0](https://github.com/jsconan/rc-tracks/releases/tag/0.3.0)

Improved design of the race track system for 1/24 to 1/32 scale RC cars.

-   A new kind of barrier has been added, defining a unibody variant: each track element is built from a single piece instead of 3.
-   The render script has been reworked, adding more options
-   The track can now have curves that are not directly related to the width lanes
-   Add wavy flags in the set of accessories

## [Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/jsconan/rc-tracks/releases/tag/0.2.0)

Improved design of the race track system for 1/24 to 1/32 scale RC cars.

-   The file structure has been updated.
-   The link between parts has been reworked for a better track cohesion.
-   The profiles have been redesigned.
-   A distinction is made between the inner and outer curves and the parts can be resized to a multiple of the main length.
-   Added shapes:
    -   Straight track chunks: simple and double length
    -   Curved track chunks: inner, outer, small, short, U-turn
    -   Special track chunks: arch to constraint the track width between two sides, U-turn compensation
    -   Track samples to draw a model of the track (default scaled to 1/10)
    -   Track accessories: led-clip, mast, flag
